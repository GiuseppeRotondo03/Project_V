# #Summary

<hr>

The goal of this project was to demonstrate my ability as a level designer and make a new level for my future FPS game under specific conditions.

# #Specifications:

<hr>

- Make a big level by recycling a few assets
- The level must not be flat, players must be able to climb on roofs of buildings / rocks / other to gain height advantage and make the game more complete, dynamic and immersive
- Making it possible, in a single map, to be able to play both close-range rifles and long-range rifles, supporting the styles of both players
- Realize the Design using Graybox and tools provided by Unreal Engine, no complex textures
- For the map there must be elements that suggest to the player the height of the head of a standing enemy, this way the player always knows where to aim
- Level for a FPS with dynamic and fast movement
- Must be a map suitable for Search and Destroy, “Location”, Death Match, Free-for-All (FFA) and domination.
- Must include new mechanics unique to the level

# #Process

<hr>

I started by deciding right away the place and the events in which the level is set. After some research, I used [image references     ](/project_v_reference.png) and the story to build some game mechanics. The idea of the project is therefore:
- The map is set in Italy, Sicily, Temple of Agrigento.
- After some events in the world of FPS (xxx) gaming, two teams of players find themselves fighting in this temple under renovation. For this reason, there are:
- Ziplines and ladders that the player can use to climb
- Unstable columns that can fall / become an obstacle / be destroyed, has HP decided by the game designer.

When I create a new level always thinking in the same way:

- “Big shape”: The first phase involves creating large boxes to understand the size of the level in a general way, without thinking about the details or the actors who will make up the level. Just an estimate.
- “Medium Shape”: The second step involves better understanding which parts will go where, starting to make an estimate of how the level will be structured, without thinking about the details, I add more complex shapes and points of interest that I want to give importance to.
- “Small Shape”: When the level is set, I start filling in all the details that will make up the final scene. (Like, for example, Box, extra columns…)

# #Actors

<hr>

Actors used to create the prototype:

![RC](/project_v_chest.png)
This cube represents a chest/container left behind by workers. It can be pierced by blows and its end delimits the height of a player. They are scattered everywhere with the aim of helping the player to aim.

![RC](/project_v_co.png)
Column There are two columns, the blue ones and the normal ones. In the final level, the artist has to convey the difference through the use of textures and other methods. The blue pillar can fall / become an obstacle / be destroyed, it has HP decided by the game designer. The blue column can also be tied to a pulley which, if destroyed, drops the column.

![RC](/project_v_upv2.png)
Crane / zip line allows players to climb above the roof of the building.

![RC](/project_v_props.png)
Colonnade / Small temple / trees are for aesthetic purposes only.

![RC](/project_v_rock.png)
Rock This group of cubes represents rocks. It is used everywhere for this purpose.


# #Feedback and how I reacted:

<hr>

- It was too dark inside the main temple, so I took pieces off the roof and added lights inside. The new roof gives more sense to the storytelling of the map, improves visibility and creates reference points for interesting lineups useful for more experienced players (For throwing grenades, smoke bombs, blackberries…).
- The spawn area for search and destroy was really small. I greatly increased the coverage of spawned players, preventing them from being spawn killed.
- Other minor fixes, such as too empty zones
